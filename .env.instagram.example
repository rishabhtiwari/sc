# Instagram API Configuration
# 
# These are YOUR APPLICATION's Facebook App credentials (not customer credentials)
# You need to create ONE Facebook App that will be used by ALL customers to connect their Instagram accounts
#
# Steps to get these credentials:
# 1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/
# 2. Create a new App (or use existing one)
# 3. Add "Instagram Basic Display" or "Instagram Graph API" product
# 4. Get your App ID and App Secret from App Settings > Basic
# 5. Add OAuth Redirect URI: http://localhost:8097/api/instagram/oauth/callback (for local dev)
#    For production, use: https://yourdomain.com/api/instagram/oauth/callback
#
# Required Permissions/Scopes:
# - instagram_basic (read basic Instagram account info)
# - instagram_content_publish (publish content to Instagram)
# - pages_read_engagement (read Facebook Page data)
#
# IMPORTANT: Each customer will use YOUR app to connect THEIR Instagram accounts
# Customer credentials are stored separately in MongoDB with customer_id/user_id

# Your Facebook App ID (same for all customers)
INSTAGRAM_APP_ID=your_facebook_app_id_here

# Your Facebook App Secret (same for all customers)
INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET=your_facebook_app_secret_here

# OAuth Redirect URI (must match what you configured in Facebook App settings)
# For local development:
INSTAGRAM_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8097/api/instagram/oauth/callback
# For production:
# INSTAGRAM_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/api/instagram/oauth/callback

# How it works:
# 1. Customer clicks "Connect Instagram Account" in the UI
# 2. They are redirected to Facebook OAuth using YOUR app credentials
# 3. They authorize YOUR app to access THEIR Instagram Business account
# 4. OAuth callback saves THEIR access token to MongoDB with THEIR customer_id
# 5. When uploading, they can choose from THEIR connected accounts
# 6. The system uses THEIR access token (not yours) to post to Instagram
